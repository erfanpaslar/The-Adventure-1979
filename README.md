# The Adventure 1979

This is a clone of "The Adventure Atari 1979"

and written in Python

just install pygame with `pip install pygame` and then run the python file

it's just level 1 and it's not even completed.

I wrote it in the middle of 2019 when i learned python, thats why the code is so messy â˜º
